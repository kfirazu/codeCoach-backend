## CodeCoach Description

CodeCoach is an app where students can learn programming with the assistance of a mentor online.

## Technologies

The technology stack I used was MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Typescript and Node.js.
The app uses webSockets to update the code blocks in real time. The API calls to the backend are done with Rest API method.

## Getting started

Clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/kfirazu/codeCoach-backend

```
Also, clone the frontend folder [here](https://github.com/kfirazu/codeCoach.git)


Enter the backend folder and make sure you have node_modules installed. After that we will initiate the server with 'npm start':

```
cd backend
npm i 
npm start
```

You should get a console output that the server is up and running at port 3030.
Enter the frontend folder and repeat the same process.

```
cd frontend
npm i 
npm start
```

You should get a console output that the application is up and running at localhost:3000.

That's it! The App should be opened automatically, enjoy!
